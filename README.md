# Frontend Coding Test

For this test you need to create an AngularJS app to browse local beers.

The beers available are found in `data/beers.js`.

A basic Express server has been created in `server.js`.

A basic AngularJS app has been created in `app`.

You will need to pull, install and build the rest of the project yourself.

## App Requirements

You do not need to fulfill all of the requirements. This is just to see how you would approach a problem.

- I want to be able to browse local beers
- I want to be able to search for beers and breweries
- I want to be able to sort and filter the results

## Technical Requirements

- Use Git
- Use AngularJS components where possible (filters/directives/services)
- Create a responsive webpage
- Use SCSS
- Bonus points for not using Bootstrap :)

## Extra Work

- I want to be able to add beers to the list
- Create some more detailed designs including extra features you would want to see
