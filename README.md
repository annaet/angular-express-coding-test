# Frontend Coding Test

For this test you need to create an AngularJS app to browse local beers.

The beers available are found in `data/beers.js`.

A basic Express server has been created in `server.js`.

A basic AngularJS app has been created in `app`.

You will need to pull, install and build the rest of the project yourself.

## App Requirements

You do not need to fulfill all the requirements. This is just to see how you would approach a problem.

- Serve beers from local data using Express
- List beers in a visually appealing way
- Provide sorting and filtering functionality
- Create a responsive webpage
- Use AngularJS components where possible (filters/directives/services)
- Bonus points for not using Bootstrap :)
